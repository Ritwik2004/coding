                    C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
                    
                    C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and 
                    allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
                    
                    C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
                    
                    C++ is fun and easy to learn!

Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it 
                is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
